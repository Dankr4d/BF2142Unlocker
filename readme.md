# BF2142 Unlocker
![Logo](bf2142unlocker.png)

## Description
This project aims to unlock all weapons in BF2142! <br />
You can equip/customize your soldier ingame. <br />
The unlocker emulates all necessary servers (login and unlock server) to play with your friends in coop/multiplayer **with all features** (except squad drones, because bot's cannot handle them). <br />
The unlocker gives you the abillity to add 64 coop maps (see below *"Optional requirements"*). <br />
**Warning:** *The actual version is slightly hacky and not stable!*

## What does not work?
- Switching mods is currently without any functionality, because auto joining the server does not work with the modPath parameter.
- Squad drones are disabled, because most of the time bots are endless spaming drones and stop moving.

## Requirements
### Install the Battlefield 2142 Server
- Windows: ftp://ftp.bf-games.net/server-files/bf2142/Battlefield_2142_Server_Unranked.exe
- Linux: ftp://ftp.bf-games.net/server-files/bf2142/bf2142-linuxded-1.10.112.0-installer.rar

## Optional requirements
### 64 Coop Maps
- Download and unzip ftp://ftp.bf-games.net/mods/bf2142/bf2142sp/2142_sp_1_5_2.zip
- Open BF2142Unlocker gui and go to settings tab (*Warning: Battlefield 2142 client and server path must be set*)
- Click on "Copy 64 coop maps (client)" and select the Levels folder from extracted zip file
- Click on "Copy 64 coop maps (server)" and select the Levels folder from extracted zip file

## Infos
- If your BF2142 game folder is read only, you need to allow elevatedio to run as administrator. Otherwise just cancel the elevation request.
- You need to set the BF2142 game path (and if you want to host the server, you also need to set the server path).
- To start the gui you need to execute the gui/gui.exe executable.
- Be carefull with the ip address you want to join. If BF2142 cannot connect to given ip address, BF2142 will stuck in a black screen.
